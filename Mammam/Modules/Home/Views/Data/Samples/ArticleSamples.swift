//                            Food chaining is a method that starts with feeding a food a child likes, then using small changes to work toward a new food.
//                            
//                            Tips For Success:
//                            - Have fun and make it a game. Encourage your child to take "mouse bites," "alligator bites," or touch the food with their tongue.
//                            - Focus on small steps & try one new item at a time. Keep trying!
//                            - Many children have to try a food more than 10 times before they start to like it.
//                            
//                            Additional Tips:
//                            - Minimize distractions while your child is eating. (For example, turn off screens, put pets in another room, etc.)
//                            - Don't pressure your child; let them decide when they want to stop.
//                            - Plan meals & snacks ahead of time. Let your child know when to expect a meal or snack.
